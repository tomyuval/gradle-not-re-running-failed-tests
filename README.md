# A minimal example of Gradle not re-running failed tests (on a multi-platform Kotlin library)

When running `./gradlew check`, the tests fail ([as they're supposed to](src/commonTest/kotlin/T.kt)):
```
$ ./gradlew check

> Configure project :
Kotlin Multiplatform Projects are an Alpha feature. See: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/evolution/components-stability.html. To hide this message, add 'kotlin.mpp.stability.nowarn=true' to the Gradle properties.

The property 'kotlin.mpp.enableGranularSourceSetsMetadata=true' has no effect in this and future Kotlin versions, as Hierarchical Structures support is now enabled by default. It is safe to remove the property.

The property 'kotlin.native.enableDependencyPropagation=false' has no effect in this and future Kotlin versions, as Kotlin/Native dependency commonization is now enabled by default. It is safe to remove the property.

Deprecated Gradle features were used in this build, making it incompatible with Gradle 8.0.

You can use '--warning-mode all' to show the individual deprecation warnings and determine if they come from your own scripts or plugins.

BUILD FAILED in 15s

(exit code: 1).

But when running `./gradlew check` a second time, everything is "up-to-date", so Gradle doesn't do anything â€“ and does
not fail:
```
$ ./gradlew check

(exit code: 0).

Note: when trying to reproduce, make sure the failure is due to the failed test and not some other reason (such as
missing Java/JDK); failure due to any other reason needs to be fixed first before the buggy behaviour described above
can be observed.
